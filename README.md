# Stick Fractal

![image resulting from algorithm, lines chaotically organized at 90-degree angles into a single square](img/63_steps.png?raw=true)

I came up with this shape sketching in a notebook during a boring college class. It exhibits some interesting patterns, so this repo is my exploration of its secrets.

## Usage
### Basic usage
`python square.py 100 15`
* Generate an image after 100 steps with 15px line lengths

### Arguments
* `-i, --interactive` - Stop generation after each step, draw and wait for user to press enter
* `-w, --width` - Set the size of the canvas to be drawn on
